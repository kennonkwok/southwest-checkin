## Creating an Issue

Issues should be used to track bug reports related to existing functionality. No new feature development is planned, but the goal is to keep the existing application functional. If you have questions about deployment (Heroku, etc), then Pull Requests are welcome if they provide instruction or application changes that make this more useful to a general audience.
